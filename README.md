Hiya! Welcome to my wargame simulator. This project spawned because I'm just exceptionally frustrated with the state
of large wargame companies and the shovelware video games they produce. They are generally very uninterested in making a viable, 3D version of their wargames, because they believe it could potentially hurt their model sales. I think that's short sighted, so I started this project.

This will be updated as it goes along. Cheers!
